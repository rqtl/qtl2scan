## qtl2scan 0.5-23 (2017-10-17)

### Minor changes

- Turn off debug C++ code

### Bug fixes

- Fix bug in `est_herit()` regarding dependent covariate columns when
  missing values in the phenotypes. Need to call `drop_depcols()`
  again after having omitted individuals with missing phenotypes.


## qtl2scan 0.5-20 (2017-08-09)

### New features

- Removed the `preserve_intercept` argument from `scan1blup()`. The
  default (`FALSE`), adding the intercept to the BLUPs, no longer
  makes sense to me. (Better to have an option in `scan1coef()` to get
  estimated genetic effects that sum to 0; which we'll add in the
  future.)

### Minor changes

- Check for linearly dependent columns in covariate matrices _after_
  omitting individuals.

- Check for +/- Inf in the phenotypes and covariates, rather than just
  NAs.

- In linear regression routines, and checks that inputs are
  appropriately sized.


## qtl2scan 0.5-18 (2017-07-09)

### Bug fixes

- Fix bug that prevented scan1() from being used with a decomposed
  kinship matrix.

- For the example contrasts in `scan1coef`, `scan1blup`, and
  `fit1`, the contrasts for the additive effect in an intercross
  should be `(-1,0,1)` not `(-0.5,0,0.5)`. Also fixed in the user
  guide.

- In `subset_kinship`, if subsetting a decomposed kinship matrix
  by individual, check whether perhaps it's not actually being changed
  in which case just ignore the `ind` argument.


## qtl2scan 0.5-14 (2017-06-05)

### Minor changes

- Revised installation instructions.

- Small changes to user guide regarding use of `library(qtl2)`.


## qtl2scan 0.5-13 (2017-05-03)

### Bug fixes

- Fixed linreg_eigen.cpp and matrix.cpp to work with
  [RcppEigen](https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppEigen) 0.3.3.3.0.


## qtl2scan 0.5-12 (2017-04-29)

### New features

- Implemented model="binary" (for phenotypes with values 0/1) in scan1,
  scan1coef, scan1perm, and fit1. (Not available with kinship
  correction.)

### Bug fixes

- Give a better error message if phenotypes (or covariates) are
  missing rownames (or, with a vector, names)

## qtl2scan 0.5-11 (2017-04-28)

### Minor fixes

- Reduce repeated code dealing with kinship matrices.

### Bug fixes

- Fix bug regarding treatment of pre-decomposed kinship matrix in
  `scan1`.

- `decomp_kinship` crashes R if input has dimension 0x0; halt with an
  error in this case.


## qtl2scan 0.5-9 (2017-04-19)

### Minor changes

- Revised `subset_scan1` (and the internal function `subset_kinship`)
  to use the same options for subsetting by chromosome as the
  functions in [R/qtl2geno](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2geno), most
  importantly use of "negative" chromosome indexes, like `"-X"`.


## qtl2scan 0.5-8 (2017-04-03)

### New features

- Added `fit1()` to fit a single-QTL model at a single fixed position
  and return the LOD score, estimated coefficients, individual
  contributions to the LOD score, and (if `se=TRUE`) standard errors.

- In `scan1coef()` and `scan1blup()`, added an argument `nullcovar`
  for covariates to include only under the null hypothesis (of no
  QTL). This is only used in the case that `kinship` is provided but
  `hsq` is not, as these may be needed for the X chromosome to get the
  estimated residual heritability.


## qtl2scan 0.5-7 (2017-03-21)

### New features

- Added `dim.calc_genoprob` and `dimnames.calcgenoprob`, from
  [Brian Yandell](https://github.com/byandell), for use with
  [qtl2feather](https://github.com/byandell/qtl2feather), which uses
  [feather](https://github.com/wesm/feather) to store
  genotype probabilities in a file (to save memory).

- In precess of revising various functions to use qtl2feather,
  particularly in grabbing dimnames (with the above functions), but
  also to avoid `seq(along=genoprobs)` and instead use
  `seq_len(length(genoprobs))`.


## qtl2scan 0.5-6 (2017-03-17)

### New features

- Added `scan1perm` to perform a permutation test to establish
  genome-wide significance in a single-QTL genome scan by `scan1`.

- Also added functions `rbind.scan1perm` and `cbind.scan1perm` for
  combining `scan1perm` results, and `summary.scan1perm` to obtain
  significance thresholds.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug in `scan1`. This would only show up if you were using a
  kinship matrix and scanning the X chromosome on its own with special
  X chr covariates (`Xcovar`). (Accidentally was acting as if it were
  an autosome and so ignoring `Xcovar`.)


## qtl2scan 0.5-5 (2017-03-13)

### New features

- Refactored to simplify the main data structures for `scan1`,
  `scan1coef`, and `scan1blup` output, and to deal with the
  refactoring of data structures in [qtl2geno](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2geno).
  Functions like `max_scan1`, `find_peaks`, `lod_int`, and `bayes_int`
  now need you to provide a map. Similarly, to subset `scan1` results
  by chromosome, you need to provide a map to the subsetting function.

- Pulled the `"snpinfo"` attribute out of the `scan1` object. Now you
  need to use `index_snps` to identify groups of equivalent SNPs prior
  to running `genoprob_to_snpprob`. `index_snps` adds some new columns
  to the `snpinfo` data frame, which are then needed by `top_snps`.
